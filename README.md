### How to use?

Please make sure that you are connecting to the CUHK VPN
1. Download the server folder
2. Unzip
3. move to `server` folder
4. run `npm install`
5. run `node server.js`

### How to update frontend?

1. Edit your code in the client folder
2. run `npm install`

` The database is connecting to 1155108980's database. It requires to reopen in sometimes. Please contact me if you want to use 1155108980's database.`

### Remark

The backend opens port 8080. Please don't change it at this moment because the frontend api is using `localhost:8080`
If you change it, it will display `Network Error`

#### Testing on VM

If you want to test the web application on your VM, please change the API_URL of files:
`client/src/services/auth.service.js`
`client/src/services/user.service.js`
Change from `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/` to `http://csci2720-g23.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/api/auth/`
